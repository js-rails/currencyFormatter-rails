This gem packages the javascript currencyFormatter.js plugin. So you never have to download a custom package through the web interface again.

CurrencyFormatter.js allows you to format numbers as currencies. It contains 155 currency definitions and 715 locale definitions out of the box. It handles unusually formatted currencies, such as the INR.

See VERSIONS.md to see which versions of tabulator-rails bundle which versions of currencyFormatter.js.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'CurrencyFormatter-rails'

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install CurrencyFormatter-rails
    
And then edit your app/assets/stylesheets/application.js file to look something like:
